## User Experience UX

### Project Goals

#### User Goals

For this project the main users frequenting the site can be split into two main categories: Investors/Potential Investors and general members of the public seeking information and/or contact. A third smaller group that can be target is potential employees.

For the First group of people they are will be either seeking general information:

- History
- Services and Technologies
- Subsidiaries
- Company leadership

or contact information:

- address and contact information
- contact form
- FAQ

They will possibly only use the site once until a new reason to visit shows up.

For the second group, they are primarily looking for:

- financial information
- subsidiaries
- technologies and products
- newsletters and company updates

 They will probably use the website at least once per month.

 For the third group, these are people who might have initially been in the first two groups but are also open to the idea of looking for a new career. They can also be people who are intentionally searching through nearby company vacancies, or even still be linked from an external job aggregate site. The important information for this group would be:

- Job Openings
- Company work culture
- Benefits
- Apprenticeship cohort dates

They could visit the site multiple times while checking for job updates

#### Business Goals

The business goals are to have a front facing part of the company that the public can interact with and reflects the companies image and principles. Their goals are also to make sure their website also offers the most use and value for the 3 groups of users outlines previously; they want to make investors happy and keep them informed, make contact and information about the company accessible to the public and attract possible talent.

### Typography 

I used Google Fonts to import the fonts for the site

The Primary font I chose was **Playfair Display**

![Playfair Display Font Preview](documentation/playfair-display-font-preview.png)

- Usage: Headings, navigation menus, and call-to-action buttons.
- Reason: Playfair Display is a serif font that combines elegance and modernity, giving a distinguished look to the headings.

The Secondary font I chose was **Lato**

![Playfair Display Font Preview](documentation/lato-font-preview.png)

- Usage: Body text, detailed descriptions, and secondary content.
- Reason: Lato is a sleek, sans-serif font that pairs well with Playfair Display, offering readability and a contemporary feel.

### Imagery

As the website is a public facing entity a large corporation, the imagery has to refelt that, showing large scale projects and cities and to impart a sense of scale. The images also need to be of professional qiuality and cannot distract from the accesibililty of the page
